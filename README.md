A2 Best way to start off is using existing APIs available. Maybe you can try some [at our company] (https://api.coinsecure.in). We have multiple API methods open. - Mohit, Coinsecure

A3 I think learning the basics of how blockchains work and getting practical programming experience with Bitcoin wallet, transactions, APIs etc is the first step. - Muneeb Ali
